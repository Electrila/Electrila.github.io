## *"What do you want to be when you grow up?"*
---

We've all been asked that question, and we've been asked a lot.  From the time we're able to talk until we become an adult and are considered "grown up", we've been asked more times than we can count.  Contemplating our future is part of human nature.  We change our minds, we develop new interests, we find our niche, and we try to build our lives around what we feel would make us happy.

As a child, I always had an answer at the ready for anyone who dared to ask the question.  I wanted to be a doctor, a famous musician, an astronaut, a teacher, a scientist, a Marine.  You get the idea.  It seemed like I changed my mind every other day, but I knew I could be anything I wanted to be if I just tried hard enough.  There was nothing I couldn't do, nothing could get in the way of my dreams, and nothing was going to stop me.

As I entered my senior year of high school, this question became a source of anxiety for me.  I realized I actually had no idea what avenue I wanted to travel in my adult life.  I was interested in everything and nothing at the same time.  I leveraged my strengths in mathematics and science and eventually settled on going to college to study finance and investment management.

***YAWN***

After just one semester, I decided I'd rather go the science route, so I switched my major to biology.  I was convinced this decision would make me happy.  It didn't.  I failed out of college after one year and was ashamed of myself because of it.  The only thing I knew for certain was that I didn't want to be someone who jumped around from job to job.  I wanted a career.  I just didn't know what that career was.

I moved five hours away from my rural hometown to a large city thinking the change of pace and scenery would inspire me, and it did...for a time.  I began attending a local community college and signed up for a variety of classes to see what interested me the most.  I realized I had a knack for anatomy and physiology, medical terminology, and disease processes.  I became more interested in the subject and enrolled in several more courses.  A year later, I finally knew what I wanted to be:

**I wanted to be a doctor.**

That idea didn't last long.  I realized I actually hated college.  The thought of attending four years at a university for an undergraduate degree, then another four years at medical school, followed by two more years for a residency and another for boards...

Although being a doctor was out of the question, I was still very interested in the medical field, so I signed up for a trade program to obtain my EMT license.  I began volunteering with Virginia Beach EMS and took a full-time job as a dispatcher for a private hospital-owned ambulance service.  I loved being an EMT because it meant I was in a position to help others, which in turn filled a hole in my life I never knew existed.  I had found my calling, but it wasn't simply being an EMT or an ambulance dispatcher; it was helping others through some of their most difficult moments.

Fast forward two years and...yep, you guessed it.  My interest waned and I decided EMS wasn't the career for me.  I still wanted to help others in difficult circumstances, so I decided to apply to police academies in the area.  I started going to the gym four to five days a week and became hyperfocused on improving my fitness level while I waited for the decisions on my applications to start rolling in.  *This*, I told myself.  *This is what I was meant to do.*

A few weeks later, I was at the gym working on my cardio and noticed I was feeling slightly..."off".  I couldn't pinpoint exactly what the issue was but I knew something wasn't right.  I became very aware of the fact that my heart was pounding much faster and harder than it should be for someone of my age and fitness level.  I used those handy EMT skills I learned and took my pulse.  It was just shy of 200 beats per minute.

*Shit.*

I went in for an EKG with my doctor and received an urgent referral for cardiology.  Two days later, I found myself sitting in an office with people that were easily three times my age.  I was terrified.  Deep down, I could sense something was seriously wrong.  Cardiology immediately referred me to the only neurologist in the area who specializes in disorders of the autonomic nervous system (the system that regulates your heart rate, breathing, digestion, bladder, blood vessels, etc.).  After a seemingly endless battery of tests and procedures, I received my official diagnosis:

[Dysautonomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysautonomia)

There is no cure for this condition and the only course of treatment is medication to manage symptoms.  The diagnosis was bad enough, but even worse was my neurologist hitting me with a reality check.

> <h1>***"You won't be able to maintain any career that involves physical activity."***</h1>

These words hit me like a ton of bricks.  I couldn't be a police officer.  I couldn't be an EMT anymore.  I couldn't do any of the things I dreamed of doing with my life.  My world was flipped upside down and I had no idea how to put the pieces of my now shattered future back together.  I was going to be confined to a desk for the rest of my life.  I was lost.

After some careful thought, I decided to stick with my ambulance dispatching job and see how the whole "office work" situation played out.  Throughout my eight year career, I found myself holding multiple different positions within the ambulance company I worked for.  I was a dispatcher.  I did QA/QI for patient care reports.  I worked in insurance and billing compliance.  I hated it all.  I was reduced to believing I'd never find a career that truly made me happy and would spend my life bouncing around from job to job because nothing could hold my interest for very long.

In December of 2019, I was forced to go on short-term disability due to a severe bipolar depression episode.  I laid in bed all day.  I had no motivation, no drive, no desire to do anything.  I zoned out in front of the TV and didn't shower for weeks at a time.  I needed help but couldn't force myself to care enough to get it.  I looked for hobbies to keep me busy but I quickly lost interest in anything I tried.  Eventually, I was forced to quit my job.

## That's when I discovered the magical world of coding!

On a whim, I signed up for a [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) account and began tinkering around with some of their free courses.  As someone who has been building custom PCs for the past ten years, I wanted to learn *how* the car ran as opposed to only knowing what's going on under the hood.  I instantly became hooked.

Fast forward several months.  I had completed a full career path, two skill paths, and 27 courses through Codecademy, from C++ to Python and everything in between.  I wasn't satisfied with focusing on just one language; I wanted to learn *everything.*  I started my very own GitHub account, I followed tech accounts on Twitter, I read articles and books, I watched YouTube videos.  I was obsessed.  I took some more free courses, completed tutorials through other programs, and began creating my own projects.  For the first time in years, everything felt right.  I felt satisfied.  I was happy.  Actually, let me rephrase: I was as happy as you can be in the midst of severe depression.

I hadn't considered any type of career in the tech industry and wanted to make sure I wouldn't lose interest in this like I had with so many other things I tried.  The months went by and my interest and desire to learn only intensified.  I was meant to do this.  I started researching schooling options and decided attending a bootcamp-style program was the right choice for me.  I finally had the motivation I was looking for to get help with my depression.

It's now May 18, 2021 and my depression is lifting.  I'm on a stable medication regimen and regularly attend therapy.  I finally worked up the courage to take the next step.  I wanted this to be more than a hobby; I wanted it to be my career.  I applied to [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/our-courses/) for their self-paced Full-Stack Software Engineering program and was over the moon when I found out I had been accepted.  At age 31, everything is finally falling into place and I'm on the exact path I was meant to travel.
